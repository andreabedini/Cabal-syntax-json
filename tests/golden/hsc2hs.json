It reads an\nalmost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and\noutputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based\non information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs\nprovide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,\nincluding sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.\n\nFor more details, see the\n<http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/utils.html#writing-haskell-interfaces-to-c-code-hsc2hs hsc2hs section>\nin the GHC User's Guide.","category":"Development","build-type":"Simple","data-files":["template-hsc.h"],"data-dir":"data/","extra-source-files":["changelog.md","test/asm/*.s"],"source-repositories":{"head":{"type":"git","location":"https://github.com/haskell/hsc2hs.git"}},"components":{"exe:hsc2hs":{"main-is":"Main.hs","c-sources":["cbits/utils.c"],"hs-source-dirs":["src/"],"other-modules":["C","Common","CrossCodegen","DirectCodegen","Flags","HSCParser","ATTParser","UtilsCodegen","Compat.ResponseFile","Compat.TempFile","Paths_hsc2hs"],"default-language":"Haskell2010","other-extensions":["CPP","NoMonomorphismRestriction"],"ghc-options":["-Wall"],"build-depends":[{"package":"base","version":">=4.3.0 && <4.21","libs":["base"]},{"package":"containers","version":">=0.4.0 && <0.8","libs":["containers"]},{"package":"directory","version":">=1.1.0 && <1.4","libs":["directory"]},{"package":"filepath","version":">=1.2.0 && <1.6","libs":["filepath"]},{"package":"process","version":">=1.1.0 && <1.7","libs":["process"]},{"_if":{"os":"windows"},"_then":[{"package":"process","version":">=1.6.8 && <1.7","libs":["process"]}]}],"cpp-options":[{"_if":{"flag":"in-ghc-tree"},"_then":["-DIN_GHC_TREE"]}]},"test:spec":{"type":"exitcode-stdio-1.0","main-is":"Spec.hs","hs-source-dirs":["src/","test/"],"other-modules":["ATTParser","Flags","BDD"],"default-language":"Haskell2010","ghc-options":["-Wall","-threaded"],"build-depends":[{"package":"base","version":">=0","libs":["base"]},{"package":"test-framework","version":">=0.8.2.0 && <0.9","libs":["test-framework"]},{"package":"test-framework-hunit","version":">=0.3.0.2 && <0.4","libs":["test-framework-hunit"]},{"package":"HUnit","version":">=1.3.1.2 && <1.4 || >=1.6.0.0 && <1.7","libs":["HUnit"]}]}}}
